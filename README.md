Code to Apply HED to videos.

Computers detect objects by identifying and locating sharp discontinuities in an image, which correspond to transitions in intensity, color and texture. The HED network aims to predict edge probabilities a multiples scales simultaneously. Its architecture consists of a fully convolutional neural network. It has demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional edge detection methods in accuracy and robustness.
